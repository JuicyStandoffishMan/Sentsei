They help to clarify communication and avoid repetition of nouns in sentences.  \n  \n## 1. これ (kore), それ (sore), and あれ (are)  \n  \nThese words are pronouns that can be used to replace nouns. They can be used alone without needing to attach to a noun.  \n  \n- **これ (kore)**: this or these (near the speaker)  \n- **それ (sore)**: that or those (near the listener)  \n- **あれ (are)**: that or those (far from both speaker and listener)  \n  \nLet's see some examples:  \n  \n1. **これ** は {何|なん} です か。(What is this?)  \n     \n   `これ (kore)` is used here because the object is close to the speaker.  \n  \n2. 彼が **それ** を {読|よ}んでいます。(He is reading that.)  \n  \n   `それ (sore)` is used here because the object is close to the listener.  \n  \n3. **あれ** は {私|わたし} の {本|ほん} でした。(That was my book.)  \n  \n   `あれ (are)` is used here because the object is far from both the speaker and the listener.  \n  \n## 2. この (kono), その (sono), and あの (ano)  \n  \nThese are demonstrative adjectives and are always followed by a noun.  \n  \n- **この (kono)**: this or these (noun) (near the speaker)  \n- **その (sono)**: that or those (noun) (near the listener)  \n- **あの (ano)**: that or those (noun) (far from both speaker and listener)  \n  \nHere are some examples:  \n  \n1. **この** {本|ほん} は {面白|おもしろ}い です。(This book is interesting.)  \n     \n   `この (kono)` is used here because the object (book) is close to the speaker.  \n  \n2. **その** {車|くるま} は {速|はや}い です ね。(That car is fast, isn't it?)  \n  \n   `その (sono)` is used here because the object (car) is close to the listener.  \n  \n3. **あの** ビル は {高|たか}かった。(That building was tall.)  \n  \n   `あの (ano)` is used here because the object (building) is far from both the speaker and the listener."

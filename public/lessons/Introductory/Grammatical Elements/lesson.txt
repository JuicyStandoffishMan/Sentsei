@Sentence
名詞(めいし)
@Translation
@Breakdown
名詞 - Noun
@Lesson
Like English, Japanese has nouns that represent people, places, things, and ideas.
One significant difference is that Japanese nouns do not have grammatical number, gender or article.

@Sentence
代名詞(だいめいし)
@Translation
@Breakdown
代名詞(だいめいし) - Pronoun
@Lesson
Japanese has pronouns, but they are used less frequently than in English. It's common in Japanese to drop the subject of the sentence if it's understood from context.

@Sentence
動詞(どうし)
@Translation
@Breakdown
動詞(どうし) - Verb
@Lesson
Verbs in Japanese are conjugated, but differently from English. They are altered based on tense, mood, voice, and politeness level. They always come at the end of a sentence or clause.

@Sentence
副詞(ふくし)
@Translation
@Breakdown
副詞(ふくし) - Adverb
@Lesson
Like English, Japanese has adverbs that modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.

形容詞(けいようし) 形容動詞(けいようどうし)
@Translation
@Breakdown
形容詞(けいようし) - Adjective
形容動詞(けいようどうし) - Adjective
@Lesson
Japanese has two types of adjectives. One behaves similarly to English adjectives, while the other, known as 'na-adjectives' or 'adjectival nouns,' behaves more like nouns and requires a form of the copula to connect it to a noun.

@Sentence
助詞(じょし)
@Translation
@Breakdown
助詞(じょし) - Particle
@Lesson
Particles are small words that indicate the relationship of a word, a phrase, or a clause to the rest of the sentence. They often signify case, direction, time, location, manner, reason, or degree. They are a unique and critical aspect of Japanese grammar.

@Sentence
感動詞(かんどうし)
@Translation

感動詞(かんどうし) - Interjection

These are words or expressions that represent emotion or sudden bursts of feelings.

@Sentence

These words connect words, phrases, or sentences.

助動詞(じょどうし) - Auxiliary Verb

These are used in conjunction with the main verb to express various states or to add nuance to the sentence.

@Sentence
助数詞(じょすうし)
@Translation
@Breakdown
助数詞(じょすうし) - Counter
@Lesson
Japanese uses specific counter words when counting different types of objects, actions, or events. The type of counter that is used depends on the characteristics of the thing being counted (for example, flat objects, round objects, animals, people, and time all have different counters).

@Sentence
連語(れんご)
@Translation
@Breakdown
連語(れんご) - Copula
@Lesson
A copula is a word used to link the subject of a sentence with a predicate. The most common Japanese copula is です (desu), but there are others, each with its own nuances.

@Sentence

@Translation
@Breakdown
擬音語(ぎおんご) - Onomatopoeia word
擬態語(ぎたいご) - Mimetic word
@Lesson
Japanese has a rich collection of sound symbolism or onomatopoeic expressions that represent sounds or states/conditions. These are often used to add expressiveness to speech or writing.

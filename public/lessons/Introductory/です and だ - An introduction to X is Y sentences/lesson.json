We will explore their uses, their role in creating simple sentences, and variations in different tenses.   \n  \n## What will you learn?  \n- Basic understanding of the copulas です (desu) and だ (da).  \n- Sentence formation using the です/だ structure: X は Y です/だ (X (noun) is Y (noun)).  \n- The use of です/だ in past and future contexts.  \n- Basic vocabulary with beginner-level Kanji.  \n- The difference in formality between です (desu) and だ (da).  \n  \n## Lesson Content:  \n  \n1. **です and だ in Present Tense**: The lesson starts with basic sentences using です (desu) and だ (da) in the present tense. This will help you to master the structure of sentences like \"This is a pen\" or \"I am a student,\" using a range of vocabulary.  \n  \n2. **です and だ in Past Tense**: Once you understand the present tense structure, we will proceed to learn the past form でした (deshita) and だった (datta). This will help you express sentences in the past like \"It was a book\" or \"He was a doctor.\"  \n  \n3. **です and だ in Future Tense**: While Japanese doesn't have a specific future tense, we will learn how to convey future meanings using time phrases like \"tomorrow\" ({明日|あした}) and certain structures with になります/になる.  \n  \n4. **Using Different Pronouns**: We will also practice the use of different pronouns like {私|わたし} (I) and {俺|おれ} (I, masculine informal), which can be used interchangeably depending on the context.  \n  \n5. **Formality Levels**: The importance of understanding the formality level differences between using です (desu) and だ (da) will be emphasized, with practical examples to illustrate their usage in different contexts.  \n  \nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to construct simple sentences using です (desu) and だ (da) and their variants, enriching your skills in expressing present, past, and future situations in Japanese while understanding appropriate context for formal and informal speech.  \n  \n## Particles: 3  \n- は  \n- の  \n- に  \n  \n## Words: 18  \n- これ  \n- ペン  \n- あれ  \n- でした  \n- だった  \n- あなた  \n- ケキ  \n- ジョン  \n- なります  \n- りんご  \n- それ  \n- ジュス  \n- だ  \n- この  \n- リンゴ  \n- なる  \n- です  \n- その  \n  \n## Kanji Words: 80 (94 unique Kanji)  \n- {赤|あか}い  \n- {学校|がっこう}  \n- {私|わたし}  \n- {家族|かぞく}  \n- {子供|こども}  \n- {夢|ゆめ}  \n- {友達|ともだち}  \n- {暑|あつ}かった。  \n- {彼|かれ}  \n- {美味|おい}しい  \n- {卵|たまご}  \n- {町|まち}  \n- {警官|けいかん}  \n- {田中|たなか}  \n- {面白|おもしろ}かった。  \n- {雪|ゆき}  \n- {夕食|ゆうしょく}  \n- {速|はや}かった。  \n- {今日|きょう}  \n- {車|くるま}  \n- {魚|さかな}  \n- {仕事|しごと}  \n- {緑色|みどりいろ}  \n- {朝|あさ}  \n- {明日|あした}  \n- {学者|がくしゃ}  \n- {桜|さくら}  \n- {僕|ぼく}  \n- {私|わたし}たち  \n- {紙|かみ}  \n- {日曜日|にちようび}  \n- {白|しろ}  \n- {火曜日|かようび}  \n- {動物|どうぶつ}  \n- {東京|とうきょう}  \n- {更|さら}に  \n- {来年|らいねん}  \n- {教師|きょうし}  \n- {鳥|とり}  \n- {氷|こおり}  \n- {教师|きょうし}  \n- {雨|あめ}  \n- {水|みず}  \n- {元気|げんき}  \n- {犬|いぬ}  \n- {猫|ねこ}  \n- {大|おお}きな  \n- {昼|ひる}  \n- {佐藤|さとう}  \n- {大|おお}きかった。  \n- {俺|おれ}  \n- {警察官|けいさつかん}  \n- {小|ちい}さな  \n- {夜|よる}  \n- {都市|とし}  \n- {来月|らいげつ}  \n- {父|ちち}  \n- {人|ひと}  \n- {名前|なまえ}  \n- {水曜日|すいようび}  \n- {日本|にほん}  \n- お{茶|ちゃ}  \n- お{寿司|すし}  \n- {先生|せんせい}  \n- {花|はな}  \n- {黒|くろ}  \n- {木|き}  \n- ご{飯|はん}  \n- {医者|いしゃ}  \n- {学生|がくせい}  \n- {海|うみ}  \n- {月曜日|げつようび}  \n- {種|たね}  \n- {天気|てんき}  \n- {本|ほん}  \n- お{昼|ひる}  \n- {彼女|かのじょ}  \n- {大人|おとな}  \n- {昨日|きのう}  \n- {最初|さいしょ}"

        "content": "## です and だ in Present Tense  \n  \n### Basic Grammar and Sentence Structure  \n  \nJapanese generally follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order, different from English's Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure. However, in our simple sentence structure for this lesson, Noun1 は Noun2 です/だ, it could be considered as following the SVO structure.  \n  \nIn this structure:  \n  \n- Noun1 is the subject/topic.  \n- The particle は (wa), pronounced as \"wa\" in this context, is a topic marker.  \n- Noun2 is the information we want to express about the subject.  \n- です (desu) or だ (da) is the copula which connects the subject with the rest of the sentence.   \n  \nFor example, in the sentence {私|わたし} は {先生|せんせい} です/だ, {私|わたし} is Noun1 or the subject (I), は is the topic marker, {先生|せんせい} is Noun2 or the information about the subject (teacher), and です/だ is the copula (am). So, the sentence translates to \"I am a teacher\".  \n  \n### Word Order  \n  \nIn Japanese, the predicate (verb or verb phrase) usually comes at the end of the sentence. The order of the other components can be flexible, but the common structure is \"Topic - Other details - Predicate\". The use of です (desu) versus だ (da) in this structure will depend on the level of formality required by the context."

Here, the subject \"これ\" is equated with the predicate \"ペン\" using the copula \"です\".\n\nThe topic marker は is often used to introduce a topic or change the topic of conversation. It does not always correspond to the subject of the sentence, unlike in English. \n\nThe pronoun \"これ\" is used when the object or person being referred to is close to the speaker. There are other similar words, such as \"それ\" (that, close to listener) and \"あれ\" (that, away from both speaker and listener), which are used depending on the spatial relationship between the speaker, listener, and the object or person being referred to. \n\n\"です\" is the polite form of \"だ\".

It is often translated as \"is\" or \"am\" in English. Note that \"です\" is used in formal or polite contexts. The plain form \"だ\" is used in more casual or informal situations."

However, it doesn't have a tense on its own. The tense of the sentence is inferred from the context or other words in the sentence (but in this sentence, there are no other tense indicators, so it is present tense). \n\nKeep in mind, \"は\" does not always translate to \"is\". The function of \"は\" is to mark the topic of the sentence, which can be the subject but could also be something else. It depends on the sentence. \n\nThe pronoun \"あれ\" is often used to refer to something that is not in close proximity to both the speaker and the listener. If the cat was close to the speaker, they would use \"これ\" (this), and if the cat was close to the listener, they would use \"それ\" (that)."

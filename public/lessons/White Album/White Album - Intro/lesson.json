The particle \"が\" often acts as the subject marker in a sentence. Japanese adjectives can be split into two types: i-adjectives and na-adjectives. Here, \"{新|あたら}しい\" is an i-adjective and ends with \"い\". These adjectives can directly modify a noun, as in \"{新|あたら}しい{部屋|へや}\" (new room) and \"{新|あたら}しい{生活|せいかつ}\" (new life). The verb \"{始|はじ}まる\" is a godan verb, one of the two main groups of verbs in Japanese. Remembering the pattern of godan verbs can be very helpful when it comes to conjugating them."

In this case, the te-form is used together with -まくる to emphasize the extent of the action (messiness in this case).\n\nThe explanatory の (ん in casual speech) is used when providing an explanation or emphasis to the situation or action.

The は particle is used to mark the topic of the sentence (the person or thing about which something is said), and the を particle is used to mark the direct object of a verb (the thing that is acted upon).

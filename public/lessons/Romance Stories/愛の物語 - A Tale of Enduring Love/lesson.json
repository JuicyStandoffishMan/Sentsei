In the case of this sentence, \"彼女に\" means \"to her\" or \"towards her\", indicating the person who the protagonist met.\n\"毎日\" (every day) is an example of a time-related adverb. It describes the frequency of the action verb, in this case, \"meeting\". These types of words typically come before the verb they modify.\nThe verb \"会う\" (to meet) is in its past form here, \"会いました\". In Japanese, the past form of a verb is used to express actions that have already been completed. To create the past form for most verbs, replace the \"u\" ending with \"imashita\".

        "lesson": "In this sentence, we have encountered the te-form of an i-adjective. This form is used to connect two sentences or clauses. The i-adjective 明るい (bright) was changed to 明るくて, allowing it to connect with the next part of the sentence. \n\nWe've also seen the use of なる (to become) in combination with an i-adjective. By using the ku-form of the adjective (大きい becomes 大きく) before なる, it means \"to become [adjective]\". In this case, 大きくなりました translates as \"became larger\". \n\nLastly, the particle の is used to indicate possession, similar to \"'s\" in English. It can connect two nouns together, with the first noun possessing the second. For example, in \"彼女の目\" (her eyes), \"彼女\" (she/her) possesses \"目\" (eyes), thus it translates as \"her eyes\".@Literal"

Remember that the topic of the sentence is marked by \"は\" and the direct object by \"を\". \n\nThe verb \"取る\" (to take) is a Godan verb, one of the two main groups of verbs in Japanese. To form the past tense of Godan verbs, you generally replace the \"u\" ending with an \"i\" ending, and then add \"ました\" to show respect or politeness.

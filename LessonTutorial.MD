# Lesson Tutorial
This will cover creating a lesson. There are generally 4 steps:

1) Setup
2) Gather your sentences
3) Create lesson.txt which contains a structured version of your sentences
4) Run fix_furigana.py to find and possibly fix missing Furigana
5) Convert the lesson.txt into a JSON file
6) Generate the audio
7) (Optional) Deploy as a zip file

## Setup
In the public/lessons folder, create a new folder or select the category you want your lesson to be in. Create a new folder for the lesson.

Next, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

## Gathering your sentences
Start by gathering the sentences you want to use. You can gather them from a visual novel, find them online, have ChatGPT generate some, or write them yourself.

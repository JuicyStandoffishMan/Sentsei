# Lesson Tutorial
This will cover creating a lesson. There are generally 4 steps:

1) Setup
2) Gather your sentences
3) Create lesson.txt which contains a structured version of your sentences
4) Run fix_furigana.py to find and possibly fix missing Furigana
5) Convert the lesson.txt into a JSON file
6) Generate the audio
7) (Optional) Deploy as a zip file

## Setup

## Gathering your sentences
Start by gathering the sentences you want to use. You can gather them from a visual novel, find them online, have ChatGPT generate some, or write them yourself.

## Create lesson.txt

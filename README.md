## What is this?
There are a hundred and one resources for learning Japanese. For me, the best way to learn has been to see sentence breakdowns.

And while you can certainly find a plethora of side-by-side sentence and word translations, a lot of material will break down new concepts and assume the reader is familiar with other things. Or maybe they don't have audio playback of the sentence or its words. Or maybe the breakdown just isn't clear enough.

This project doesn't solve that - it's merely a set of tools to enable a rich interface that enables all of the above when they're available. There are some lessons and breakdowns generated by ChatGPT-4 though, and it does a pretty good job for simple stuff. So if you want to create a lesson or import your own sentences, see [the lesson tutorial](LessonTutorial.MD).

## Creating your own lessons
### Loading lessons locally
On the homepage, just click "Upload Local Lesson" at the top and open &lt;lesson&gt;.zip. Make sure it contains lesson.json and optionally an Audio folder with the selected works. There's more info in the tutorial.

**Note:** The file is just extracted and read locally; nothing is sent remotely.
